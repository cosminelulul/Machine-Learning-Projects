# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook ML Projects from 3rd year course of Machine Learning . 
***
## Project 1:
Using a Hospital Appointments Dataset, we studied and cleaned the dataset, highlighting anomalies/unique entries.
***
## Project 2:
Using a dataset that  contains information about video game sales, including titles, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, and regional sales. The purpose of the analysis was  to understand the factors that influence the commercial success of video games and to build predictive models for estimating global sales.
***
## Project 3:
Using a dataset around Chicago House Pricing, we studied methods such as the Linear regression model, regularization using Ridge and Lasso models and GridSearchCV.
***
## Project 4:
Using a Job Placement Dataset, we studied a binary classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether a student has been placed in a job (Placement = Placed) or not (Placement = Not Placed) based on academic characteristics, scores, and previous experience.
***
## Project 5:
Using a Bank Loan Classification Dataset, we studied the Decision Tree model, Random Forest model, and a Boosting model, comparing them and seeing which model offered the best score.
***
## Project 6:
Using a JobPosting Prediction Dataset, we classified fake/real job postings using MLPClassifier model.
*** 
## Project 7:
Using a Wine Quality Dataset, we used Clustering techniques(such as K-Means,GMM,DBSCAN) and calculated the Silhouette, ARI & FM metrics to determine which algorithm was the best.
